        <p>Every single plant has its own DNA strand, biomass, and age.</p>
        <p>
          At the very start, each species is randomly dropped in a grid with 6
          newborn plants. Each species is given two randomly generated DNA
          strands. This is to help encourage gene diversity so every species is
          not composed entirely of clones!
        </p>
        <p>
          Every “turn” plants grow according to their growth rate (determined by
          their genes) and the buffs and debuffs by adjacent plants. Friendly
          plants (generally) give a growth rate bonus, while plants of the
          opposite species give a growth rate penalty. Once plants grow enough
          and hit a threshold they become mature enough to reproduce. At this
          point every “turn” they have a chance to reproduce, if another plant
          is mature in their same tile. When two plants mate, their offspring is
          a combination of the parents.This will continue until the plants die
          of old age.

          Plants exchange DNA and express traits given the guidelines of
          Mendelian genetics, which can be read about{' '}
