        <h2>Welcome to Gaea!</h2>
        <p>
          Gaea is a tool meant to demonstrate in real time the very basics of
          Natural Selection, and in turn teach you about evolution while also
          giving a brief overview of Mendelian Genetics. To get the best out of
          Gaea, keep the following concepts in mind.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Natural selection doesn’t necessarily mean the strongest survives,
            <b>it simply means the one who reproduces the most.</b>{' '}
          </li>
          <li>
            At a very basic level, evolution is the slow change of what genes
            are being expressed in a species over a long period of time.{' '}
            <b>
              More favorable traits are passed down, less favorable traits are
              expressed less or lost over time.
            </b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With these two core concepts in mind you can start utilizing Gaea to
          witness how these things function in an environment! So Gaea will
          spawn 3 species of plants (with randomized dna strands) randomly
          within the field, and generally the very beginning of the simulation
          is the most tumultuous. This is an ideal time to see natural
          selection, as generally one or two species quickly perish while one
          takes over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially when you start just run the simulation several times to get
          an idea how things look. Then you should start delving into the Gene
          expression to try and explain why certain species do poorly. Once you
          get more accustomed to it, you should be able to accurately predict
          which species will do poorly!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>But how do I do that, there's so much going on!</b>It’s not as bad
          as it seems! Every trait has an explanation beneath it of how it
          functions in the simulation. I’d recommend just trying to focus on one
          trait initially, perhap nGRi (Negative growth rate influence) for
          example. Negative growth rate influence means any other species in an
          adjacent tile grows slower. So if on the initial seeding of plants you
          see one species is adjacent to both other species it is likely it will
          do poorly compared to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          However it's important to check what genes they have and what genes
          are being expressed, as it's possible they actually have a negative
          nGRi, meaning that they actually help adjacent plants!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Some easy things to look out for.</b> I’d recommend just trying to
          focus on one trait initially, LS (Life Span). This trait is very easy
          to interpret, longer life span means more chances to breed, so longer
          life span will almost always succeed. As you can see if you can check
          the trait values, all the recessive traits are much better than the
          dominant genes in this case. So despite being rare to express they
          should become more prominent over time. Simply let the simulation run
          a minute and check the remaining species, they will almost assuredly
          be expressing the recessive traits for LS in higher numbers then they
          started. An excellent example of Natural Selection!{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that if the original values show 100% for a
          recessive gene, that means the dominant gene does not exist for that
          species and can never become present! Go here for a further
          explanation.
